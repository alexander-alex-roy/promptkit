## Animagine XL 4.0 Prompt Engineering Rules (from official Hugging Face documentation)

### Core Capabilities
- **Ultimate Anime Model**: Finetuned SDXL model for high-quality anime image generation
- **8.4M Dataset**: Trained on 8.4M diverse anime-style images from various sources
- **Knowledge Cutoff**: January 7, 2025
- **Opt Variant**: Optimized version with improved stability, anatomy accuracy, noise reduction, color saturation, and overall color accuracy

### Prompt Structure — Tag Ordering Method (CRITICAL)
The model was trained using the **tag ordering method** for identity and style training[reference:0][reference:1]. For optimal results, follow this structured template[reference:2]:

**1girl/1boy, character name, from what series, everything else in any order**

### Detailed Prompt Template
1. **Quality Tags** (always include at the end): "masterpiece, high score, great score, absurdres"
2. **Subject**: "1girl" or "1boy" — always start with this
3. **Character Name**: If generating a specific character
4. **Series**: If generating from a specific franchise
5. **Attributes**: Hair color, eye color, clothing, pose, expression
6. **Background**: Setting, environment
7. **Quality Tags**: "masterpiece, high score, great score, absurdres"

### Quality Tags
- **Positive**: masterpiece, high score, great score, absurdres
- **Negative**: lowres, bad anatomy, bad hands, text, error, missing fingers, extra digit, fewer digits, cropped, worst quality, low quality, low score, bad score, average score, signature, watermark, username, blurry

### Example Prompt
"1girl, green hair, sweater, looking at viewer, upper body, beanie, outdoors, night, turtleneck, masterpiece, high score, great score, absurdres"

### Recommended Settings
- **Width/Height**: 832×1216 (portrait), 1216×832 (landscape), or 1024×1024
- **Guidance Scale**: 7
- **Inference Steps**: 28
