## Pika 2.2 Pikaframes Prompt Engineering Rules (from official Pika documentation)

### Core Capabilities
- **Image-to-Video**: Turns one or more still images into animated video[reference:46]
- **Keyframe Control**: Upload up to 5 keyframes with per-transition prompts and durations[reference:47]
- **Extended Duration**: Total runtimes up to 25 seconds[reference:48]
- **1080p Output**: High-resolution video generation[reference:49]
- **Global Prompt Control**: A single high-level prompt controls look, atmosphere, and camera behavior[reference:50][reference:51]

### Prompt Structure
1. **Global Prompt**: One or two sentences describing the overall scene and motion[reference:52][reference:53]
2. **Transitions (Optional)**: Per-segment prompts for local refinement[reference:54]
3. **Duration**: Set per-segment durations to control timing[reference:55]
4. **Resolution**: Select 720p or 1080p[reference:56]
5. **Seed**: Use fixed integer for reproducibility[reference:57]

### Best Practices
- Write a single global prompt describing the overall scene and motion[reference:58]
- For multiple images: they act as keyframes; the video evolves from the first to the last in order[reference:59]
- For single image: the model animates around that scene with camera moves[reference:60]
- Use per-segment transitions for local overrides or refinements[reference:61]
- Total video length is roughly the sum of all transition durations[reference:62]
- If no transitions are set, a 5-second clip is generated by default[reference:63]

### Example Global Prompt
"TV screen flickering in a cozy kitchen, soft camera shake, warm cinematic lighting"[reference:64]
