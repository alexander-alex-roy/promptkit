## Recraft V4.1 Prompt Engineering Rules

### Core Capabilities
- **Most expressive Recraft model**: Brings its own creative point of view, making design choices on light, mood, and composition[reference:8][reference:9]
- **Quieter, more realistic photorealism**: Produces images that feel lived-in and human, not like stock photos[reference:10][reference:11]
- **Excels with short prompts**: Can read a few words and get the aesthetic right, filling gaps with taste[reference:12][reference:13][reference:14]
- **New illustration styles**: Unlocks styles not previously possible[reference:15]
- **Smoother 3D gradients**: Renders 3D with natural light and depth[reference:16]
- **Available in**: Standard (1MP) and Pro (4MP) for high resolution[reference:17]

### Prompt Structure
1. **Core concept**: Subject(s) and scene[reference:18]
2. **Background and environment**: Where the subjects exist[reference:19]
3. **Primary subject framing and pose**: Pose and expression[reference:20]
4. **Physical attributes and identity details**: Identity and appearance[reference:21]
5. **Secondary subjects and spatial relationships**: If needed[reference:22]
6. **Lighting direction and behavior**: Light source and quality[reference:23]
7. **Camera, depth, and contrast**: How the scene is captured[reference:24]
8. **Mood and compositional resolution**: Emotional tone and composition[reference:25]

### Best Practices
- **Short prompts work well**: V4.1 can interpret minimal input with taste[reference:26]
- **For vector/logo work**: Avoid texture/material-focused language; focus on structural definition and geometric clarity[reference:27]
- **For cinematic images**: Describe light, camera, and motion control, not just the feel[reference:28]
- **For lifestyle images**: Focus on authenticity, context, and natural behavior[reference:29]
- **Structured prompts** yield intentional, controllable, and repeatable results[reference:30]
