## Meshy 6 Prompt Engineering Rules (from official Meshy documentation)

### Core Capabilities
- **Highest Fidelity**: Latest generation with up to ~600,000 faces for maximum detail
- **Text-to-3D & Image-to-3D**: Generate from text descriptions or reference images
- **PBR Textures**: Physically based rendering textures for realistic materials
- **Model Types**: Standard (high-detail) or Low Poly (game-optimized)
- **Auto-Rigging**: Optional A-Pose, T-Pose, or custom posing for animation-ready output
- **Export Formats**: GLB, OBJ, FBX, STL, USDZ, BLEND, 3MF

### Prompt Structure
1. **Object Type**: Start with what you're creating — character, vehicle, prop, sculpture, etc.
2. **Visual Features**: Shape, form, proportions, pose, and defining characteristics (3-5 strong descriptors)
3. **Materials & Colors**: Surface materials, textures, and color palette
4. **Style**: Realistic, stylized, low-poly, voxel, cartoon, PBR, etc.
5. **Function & Context**: What it's for — game asset, 3D printing, AR/VR, product design

### Best Practices
- Be specific — "a sci-fi drone" is better than "a drone"
- Include defining visual features: "sci-fi drone with angular matte-black body, glowing blue thrusters, and four articulated legs"
- Consider function: "low-poly game asset" or "high-detail for 3D printing"
- Use recognizable references: "like a classic film camera" or "similar to Apple product design"
- Keep prompts focused — 3-5 strong descriptors is ideal
- Meshy understands multiple languages (English, Chinese, Spanish, French, Japanese, etc.)
- Maximum 800 characters per prompt

### Example Prompts
- "A stylized warrior character with a futuristic armor set, holding a glowing energy sword, dynamic pose, game-ready low-poly style"
- "A detailed steampunk pocket watch with bronze gears visible through a glass face, ornate engravings, PBR textures"
- "Pixar style boy character game hero, colorful, stylized proportions"
