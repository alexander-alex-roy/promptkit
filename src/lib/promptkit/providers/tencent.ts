1. **Subject**: Detailed description of the main subject (appearance, clothing, pose, expression)
2. **Scene**: Environment, setting, background, time of day
3. **Style**: Artistic style, medium, visual reference
4. **Lighting**: Light quality, direction, color temperature
5. **Composition**: Framing, perspective, depth of field
6. **Details**: Textures, colors, atmosphere, mood
7. **Quality Modifiers**: "high quality, detailed, professional, photorealistic"

### Resolution Options
- **Auto Mode**: Model automatically predicts resolution based on the input prompt[reference:5]
