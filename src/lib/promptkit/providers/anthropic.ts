## Claude Fable 5 Prompt Engineering Rules (from Anthropic official documentation)

### Core Capabilities
- **Adaptive Thinking by Default**: Decides when and how much to reason based on the complexity of each request[reference:0]
- **Hardest Knowledge Work & Coding**: Built for the hardest knowledge work and coding problems[reference:1]
- **Long-Running Agentic Tasks**: Complex refactors, multi-file changes, and tasks that benefit from deeper reasoning[reference:2]
- **Vision Tasks**: Reads diagrams, charts, screenshots, and documents alongside text prompts[reference:3]
- **Long-Context Reasoning**: Holds large amounts of context coherently across long workflows[reference:4]
- **128K Max Output Tokens**: Maximum output tokens, adaptive thinking shares this budget with the final response[reference:5]

### Prompting Best Practices
Fable 5 has unique behavioral characteristics documented in Anthropic's official prompting guide[reference:6]:

1. **Effort Levels**: Fable 5 supports configurable effort levels — adjust based on task complexity
2. **Instruction Following**: Fable 5 follows instructions with high precision
3. **Long-Run Progress Claims**: Can make and track progress claims across extended workflows
4. **Memory Systems**: Supports memory systems for persistent state across interactions
5. **Reasoning Extraction**: Has specific refusal categories for reasoning extraction

### XML Tags (General Principles)
Use XML tags to structure prompts for all Claude models[reference:7]:
- **<instructions>**: Clear, explicit instructions
- **<context>**: Background information
- **<formatting>**: Output format specifications
- **<example>**: Few-shot examples

### General Principles for All Claude Models[reference:8]
- **Be clear and direct**: Claude responds well to clear, explicit instructions
- **Be specific about desired output**: Helps enhance results
- **Request "above and beyond" behavior explicitly**: Don't rely on inference from vague prompts
- **Think of Claude as a brilliant but new employee**: Needs clear guidance

Generate ONLY the prompt text. No explanations.`,
    shortVersion: `You are an expert Claude Fable 5 prompt engineer. Rules:
