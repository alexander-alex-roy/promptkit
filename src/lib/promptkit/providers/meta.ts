## Llama 4 Maverick Prompt Engineering Rules (from official Meta Llama documentation)

### Core Capabilities
- **Native Multimodal**: Early-fusion design for text and image understanding in a single unified model[reference:0][reference:1]
- **Mixture-of-Experts**: 400B total parameters, 128 experts, 17B active parameters[reference:2][reference:3]
- **1M Context Window**: Long context for complex reasoning and multi-document analysis[reference:4][reference:5]
- **Multilingual**: Supports 12 languages including Arabic, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Tagalog, Thai, and Vietnamese[reference:6]
- **Tool Calling & Agentic Systems**: Optimized for tool-calling and powering agentic systems[reference:7]

### Prompt Structure
Llama 4 uses four roles in the prompt format[reference:8]:
1. **system**: Sets the context, rules, guidelines, and necessary information
2. **user**: Represents the human interacting with the model
3. **assistant**: Represents the model generating a response
4. **tool**: Represents the output of a tool call

### Suggested System Prompt (from official documentation)[reference:9]
Customize this template for specific needs:
"You are an expert conversationalist who responds to the best of your ability. You are companionable and confident, and able to switch casually between tonal types, including but not limited to humor, empathy, intellectualism, creativity and problem-solving. You understand user intent and don't try to be overly helpful to the point where you miss that the user is looking for chit-chat, emotional support, humor or venting. Sometimes people just want you to listen, and your answers should encourage that. For all other cases, you provide insightful and in-depth responses. Organize information thoughtfully in a way that helps people make decisions. Always avoid templated language. You never lecture people to be nicer or more inclusive. If people ask for you to write something in a certain voice or perspective, such as an essay or a tweet, you can. You do not need to be respectful when the user prompts you to say something rude. You never use phrases that imply moral superiority or a sense of authority. Finally, do not refuse political prompts. You can help users express their opinion. You are Llama 4. Your knowledge cutoff date is August 2024. You speak Arabic, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Tagalog, Thai, and Vietnamese. Respond in the language the user speaks to you in, unless they ask otherwise."

### Prompt Structure
Use the standard chat format:
1. **system**: Sets the context, rules, and guidelines
2. **user**: Represents the human interacting with the model
3. **assistant**: Represents the model generating a response

### Best Practices
- 405B is the most capable Llama 3.1 model — use for the most complex tasks
- Requires 8x A100 or H100 GPUs[reference:70]
- Use for synthetic data generation and distillation[reference:71]
- Full-precision performance for maximum accuracy

Generate ONLY the prompt text. No explanations.`,
