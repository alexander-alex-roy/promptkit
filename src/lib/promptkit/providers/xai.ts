## Grok 4.3 Prompt Engineering Rules (from official xAI documentation)

### Core Capabilities
- **Flagship Model**: Leads the industry in non-hallucination rate and agentic tool calling capabilities[reference:0][reference:1]
- **1M Context Window**: 1,000,000 token context for long documents and conversations[reference:2][reference:3]
- **Configurable Reasoning**: Supports reasoning_effort parameter — none, low, medium, high[reference:4]
- **Multimodal**: Accepts text and image inputs[reference:5]
- **Function Calling**: Native tool calling and structured output support[reference:6][reference:7]

### Prompt Structure
1. **System Prompt**: Define role, expertise, and behavioral constraints
2. **Task**: Clear, specific instruction
3. **Context**: Relevant background (leverage 1M context)
4. **Output Format**: Desired structure (JSON, markdown, code, etc.)
5. **Examples**: Include 1-2 few-shot examples

### Reasoning Effort Guidelines
- **none**: For straightforward, simple tasks
- **low**: For everyday tasks where speed matters
- **medium**: Default balanced setting
- **high**: For complex reasoning and accuracy-critical tasks

### Real-Time Data Integration
- Enable server-side search tools (Web Search / X Search) for real-time data[reference:8]
- Grok has no knowledge of current events beyond its training data (cutoff: November 2024) without search tools enabled[reference:9][reference:10]

### Best Practices
- No role order limitation: system, user, assistant roles can be mixed in any sequence[reference:11][reference:12]
- For image inputs: max 20MiB, jpg/jpeg or png supported, any image/text input order accepted[reference:13]
- Grok 4 is best for one-shot Q&A and complex concepts[reference:14]

    systemPrompt: `You are an expert Grok Build 0.1 prompt engineer. Generate the best possible prompts for xAI's agentic coding model.

## Grok Build 0.1 Prompt Engineering Rules (from official xAI documentation)

### Core Capabilities
- **Agentic Coding**: Trained specifically for agentic coding workflows[reference:15][reference:16]
- **256K Context**: 256,000 token context window[reference:17][reference:18]
- **Fast & Cost-Effective**: 4x the speed and 1/10th the cost of other leading agentic models[reference:19]
- **Early Access**: Currently in early access[reference:20][reference:21]

### Prompt Structure for Coding Tasks
1. **Language & Framework**: Specify programming language and version
2. **Task**: Clear description of what to accomplish
3. **Context**: Provide relevant code context (select specific code)[reference:22]
4. **Requirements**: Explicit goals and requirements[reference:23]
5. **Output Format**: Desired code structure

### Best Practices (from xAI official guide)
- **Provide Necessary Context**: Select specific code as context, specify relevant file paths, project structures, or dependencies. Avoid irrelevant context. Example: "My error codes are defined in @errors.ts, can you use that as reference to add proper error handling to @sql.ts"[reference:24]

- **Set Explicit Goals**: Avoid vague prompts. Use concrete, detailed queries. Example: "Create a food tracker which shows the breakdown of calorie consumption per day divided by different nutrients when I enter a food item"[reference:25]

- **Continually Refine**: Take advantage of rapid and cost-effective iteration to refine queries. Example: "The previous approach didn't consider the IO heavy process which can block the main thread, we might want to run it in its own threadloop"[reference:26]

- **Assign Agentic Tasks**: Use grok-build-0.1 for agentic-style tasks rather than one-shot queries. It excels at navigating large codebases with tools.[reference:27]

### Key Comparison
- **grok-build-0.1**: Great at working quickly and tirelessly to find answers or implement changes[reference:28]
- **Grok 4.3**: Best for diving deep into complex concepts and tough debugging[reference:29]
